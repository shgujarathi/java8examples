Hi, this is regarding service history details in my EPF account. I switched office in 2017 where my new employer created new UAN instead of tagging new EPF account to existing/old UAN. And I was directed to initiate EPF transfer from old account to new account using FORM 13. Now my EPF amount got transferred from old account to new account (Verified by looking into passbook of both accounts). But EPS section was not mentioned in passbooks. So I read in one article saying pension scheme will not be transferred and it will be decided on service of employee. And those details will be captured at EPF office where transfer initiated. So I also understood that I can see those old Employer details in service history of new account to which transfer was done. I my case I am unable to see old service details in Service History of new Account.
